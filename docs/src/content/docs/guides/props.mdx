See the [TypeScript](/guides/typescript#props) page for information on how to generate types for your props.
</Aside>

You can provide data to your routes by annotating functions in your php class.

Data is accessed in vue through `@tanstack/vue-query` [useQuery](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/vue/guides/queries) composables to take full advantage of their caching, refetching, loading states, etc. It's a great package!

By default, props are always included on first page visit.

```vue
<template>
  <p>{{ serverTime }}</p>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { usePage } from '@ozmos/viper-vue';

const page = usePage<ViperGen.Example>();

const { data: serverTime } = page.useQuery('serverTime');
</script>

<php>
return new class {
  #[\Ozmos\Viper\Attrs\Prop]
  public function serverTime(): string
  {
    return now()->toIso8601String();
  }
};
</php>
```

## Refetching

You can refetch props by calling `refetch()` on your query.

Refetch only fetches this specific prop, not any other props loaded with the page.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { usePage } from '@ozmos/viper-vue';

const page = usePage<ViperGen.Example>();

const { refetch } = page.useQuery('serverTime');
</script>
```

## Lazy Loading

If you don't want to fetch the prop on the first visit of the page you can pass `lazy: true` to the attribute.

This will omit the prop until it is manually fetched with `refetch()`.

```vue
<template>
  <p>{{ serverTime || "Not fetched yet" }}</p>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { usePage } from '@ozmos/viper-vue';

const page = usePage<ViperGen.Example>();

const { data: serverTime } = page.useQuery('serverTime');
</script>

<php>
return new class {
  #[\Ozmos\Viper\Attrs\Prop(lazy: true)]
  public function serverTime(): string
  {
    return now()->toIso8601String();
  }
};
</php>
```

## Container Injection

Prop functions are proxied through `app()->call(...)` and can take advantage of Laravel's service container.

```vue
<template>
  <p>{{ name }}</p>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { usePage } from '@ozmos/viper-vue';

const page = usePage<ViperGen.Example>();

const { data: name } = page.useQuery('name');
</script>

<php>
return new class {
  #[\Ozmos\Viper\Attrs\Prop]
  public function name(\Illuminate\Http\Request $request): string
  {
    return $request->user()->name;
  }
};
</php>
```

## Why use attributes?

Other frameworks like Livewire expose any public class properties as data to the frontend, why didn't we?

```php
return new class {
  public \App\Models\User $user;

  public mounted()
  {
    $this->user = request()->user();
  }
};
```

While this approach works for them, I don't see the same mental model with Viper. There should be no concept of backend state like properties in this case since all of your state is orchestrated from the frontend.

There is no lifecycle to learn (like `mounted()`) with classes and attributes. Actions and props only get evaluated when they're asked for.
