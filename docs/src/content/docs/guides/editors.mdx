## PhpStorm

<Aside>
These instructions were taken from the now sunset [fusion-php/fusion](https://github.com/fusion-php/fusion) docs. Thank you [Aaron](https://x.com/aarondfrancis)!

If you're using PhpStorm, you may configure a "Language Injection" to alert the editor that the language inside the
`<php>` block is PHP.

In your preferences, look for Editor > Language Injections. In the top left you'll see a plus sign (+).

![PhpStorm 01](../../../assets/php-storm-01.png)

From that menu, choose "XML Tag Injection".

![PhpStorm 02](../../../assets/php-storm-02.png)

Then enter the following details.

![PhpStorm 03](../../../assets/php-storm-03.png)

This should make your editing experience much nicer.

An editor plugin will come eventually.

## VSCode

We do not currently have a solution for VSCode syntax highlighting at this time.

It is recommended to use the `mode => 'adjacent'` config to regain highlighting and code completion.
